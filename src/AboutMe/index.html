        <h2>Welcome to Lucy's Homepage!</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Lucy and I am currently working as a research assistant at Interactive Neurorehabilitation Lab, USC. 
            I lead the development of the interactive interfaces to meet specific needs of clinicians. 
            My focus is on React web application development and data analysis. I have been working on creating and maintaining web applications as well as collecting and analyzing data related to our research projects. 
            I am excited about the opportunity to work in this field and contribute to our team's success!

            Web Development and Data Analysis at Bosch Automotive Products Co., Ltd
          </h3>
          <subtitle>Suzhou, China
            — August 2021 - December 2021</subtitle>           
          <p>            
            Worked in the department of Chassis Systems Control and under the team of Product Management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scraped data from Bosch’s internal website, and used the data to build PowerBI KPI reports. With these
reports, Product Managers can visualize projects and problems’ status, and oversee unusual trends . All
reports are up-to-date, and well-organized in MSTeams to promote easy access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solved the pain points of Bosch’s long training process by building an online training system using
PowerApps and PowerAutomate, which enables more functionalities and saves more time compared to the
original training process. This online training system has been put to use since Sept 2022.

          <p>            
            Collaborated with a team of six on FSE (Flawless Segmented Execution), a business framework that equips
            teams with data processing tools needed to find out more potentially profitable sales points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Utilized Pandas and Numpy to manage and collect features for profitable stores, then created a prediction
model to determine stores worthy of investment based on sales data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Used Machine Learning (Scikit Learn, Logistic Regression) to predict stores worth investment, based on
features of successful sales points.

          <p>            
Created a web page that allows its users to search for artists using the Artsy API. The results of the search
will be listed as a list of artist cards. When a user clicks on an artist card, details about the chosen artist will
be shown underneath. The web site is deployed to GCP, and has two version, version 1 has server-side
scripting using Python, Flask, JSON, AJAX, and version 2 utilizes Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap, JavaScript,
Node.js, Express, AJAX, and JSON.

          <subtitle>Data Science Project January 2021 - March 2021</subtitle>           
          <p>            
            Obtained the opioid abusers and control’s data from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. Checked the data
            quality, and trimmed unnecessary sequences from the reads. Got gene expression counts, and performed
            various gene expression analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Presented genome-wide changes in midbrain gene expression associated with human opioid abuse.
Identified specific gene networks which grouped genes similar in expression together. Learned that people
who use opioid have greater gene expression variability than those who do not use them.

            Obtained the movie datasets from Kaggle. Cleaned the datasets and had 380 predictors and 9000
            observations.
          </p><p>
            Tried Forward Stepwise Regression, PCA, and Lasso Regression for feature selection, and found Lasso
            Regression with the highest cross-validation scores. Used a linear regression model to predict movie rating
            and found the top ten important features.
